## OOP Principles Used

1. **Encapsulation**: Data and methods are encapsulated within classes
2. **Abstraction**: Complex operations are hidden behind simple interfaces
3. **Inheritance**: Classes can be extended for additional functionality
4. **Polymorphism**: Methods can be overridden for different behaviors
